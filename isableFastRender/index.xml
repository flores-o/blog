      <description>Working towards easily accessing the first Jhanna states. Teachers: Rob Burbea, Jhourney Team. I meditate 2 hours/day and review the sessions here. Prev experience: Vipassana retreats (Goenka, 2021/UK, 2022/USA, would love to sit the third), the realization process with Judith Blacksmith, etc. Suggestions? DM me on twitter If you have worked through the first jhannas and have suggestions, I&amp;rsquo;ll open the doc for comments. I love Rob Burbea teachings, if you think I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate a different teaching or practice, feel free to share.</description>

      <title>[Book] Negotiation by Chriss Voss</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/archive/post-4/</link>

      <description>I. Principles of negotiation Negotiation was seen as a zero-sum game for a long time. The goal was to get as much out of the interaction as possible – but always at your opponent’s expense. Your counterpart was your enemy, and the negotiation was a battle.&#xA;The adversary is not the person across the table; the adversary is the situation.&#xA;The person across the table is your negotiating partner – that you can work with against the situation, so that you are both better off.</description>

      <description>What is confidence? Optimism, hope and self-esteem can be confused with confidence. They differ in one fundamental way, confidence empowers action. The future in uncertain. Confidence is a mental stance towards the future that defies the uncertainty by betting on success.&#xA;4 types of confidence: can&amp;rsquo;t do/can&amp;rsquo;t happen; can do/can&amp;rsquo;t happen; can&amp;rsquo;t do/can happen; can do/can happen.&#xA;How Confidence Works Lack of confidence often arises because goals are not clear and attention is not sharply focused on them.</description>

      <description>IMPORTANT NOTE: All of us, myself included, are biased, whether we admit it or not. And thinking that we are objective can actually make this even worse, creating what social scientists call a “bias blind spot.” This blind spot causes people to be too confident about their own powers of objectivity so that they fail to correct for bias.&#xA;The leadership ambition gap, what would you do if you weren&amp;rsquo;t afraid A recent survey of Millenials found that women were just as likely to describe themselves as ambitious as men.</description>

      <description>I interviewed a lot in my short work experience and I got rejected. And I got offers. Google, Amazon, DeepMind, Facebook, Bloomberg, Skyscanner, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley.&#xA;I compiled here all the advice that I give to my friends when they ask or when they don’t ask.\&#xA;What you need to know? Data structures and algorithms. Only one subject out of the entire Computer Science degree.&#xA;You also need to know the time and space complexity of every data structure.</description>
