* Sleep plenty and wake up without an alarm. 
* Eat wholesome food
* Exercise and body work (I love massages)
* Meditate


Note: 
* The house that I live in with the lovely aussies in my life are supportive of these behaviours.
* Running notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qgVkNyeafBwT7qVH832djBVCfdmoSD00rnzPte4Qug8/edit?usp=sharing)
* Working out is one fav friend activity. If we know each other, we can gym together, a one off/ regulars. I do Barry's and we have weights in our backyard. Curious about calisthenics, silks, etc.
