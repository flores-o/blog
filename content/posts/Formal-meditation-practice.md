* If you have worked through the first jhannas and have suggestions, I'll open [the doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/124IimoVRsF_TeYrDOBpnTUmpNdLG8XIIVnbuyN56Gmo/edit?usp=sharing) for comments.
* I love Rob Burbea teachings, if you think I'd appreciate a different teaching or practice, feel free to share.
